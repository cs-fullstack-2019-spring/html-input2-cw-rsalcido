### 1.5 POINT
### Mostly correct but missing required setting for some fields 'First and Last name required, as well as checkbox for agreeing to the terms'. lastly, no comments

# HTML Input 2 CW

Duplicate the form depicted in the included image. Note the following:

* Use placeholders where shown
* Make First and Last name required, as well as checkbox for agreeing to the terms
* Use the proper 'type' field for ```email```, ```password```, and ```birthday```
* Style as close to the example as you can but feel free to add additional styling (as it is quite the boring form...)
